## This is photography website showing some of the most beautiful photos taken around the world. The website entails waterfalls, forests both man-made and indegenous, with beautiful views and pathways where people can take walks to interact with nature. we can see birds having a great time in old rugged branches of an old tree. the breath taking photos makes you despise the human actions of deforestation which is so rampant in this day and age. We also get to see how people have come up with innovative ways of creating beauty in their homes by building bridges to preserve the free flow of water bodies to ensure the trees are well nourished, those next to the river, therefore creating a wonderful garden. Therapy can be found within the nature.

## Known Bugs
{ There are no issues unresolved issues at the moment other than keeping up with our innovative spirit which calls for constant improvement on ways of advocating for the conservation of forests waterbodies especially in this day and age where land grabbing and negative human practises have led to the loss of many trees through deforestation as well as grabbing of riparian land and diverting for human settlement. through business processes re-engineering we invite partners to share insights on ways to conserve the environment.}
